  short_description: "CHERI fork of BoehmGC"
  description: |-
    The Boehm–Demers–Weiser garbage collector, often simply known as the Boehm GC or Boehm collector, is a conservative garbage collector for C and C++. It has been ported to CheriBSD/Morello and CheriBSD/RISC-V.

    This work has been documented in a short research paper at [VEE 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3516807.3516823).
  status: |-
    Some CHERI purecap support is upstreamed at https://github.com/ivmai/BDWGC with slightly more extensive downstream support at https://github.com/capablevms/BDWGC
    
    At the moment, the GC only works in single-threaded, non-incremental mode.
